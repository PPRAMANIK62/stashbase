/** Expand and collapse: the one travel in this kit that is NOT a spring.
 *  A region's size is a box of space opening and closing, not an object
 *  arriving, and a spring's launch reads as a shove when what it displaces is
 *  every row below it or the whole column beside it. What it takes instead is
 *  a symmetric ease: the same shape entering and leaving, because opening and
 *  closing are one reversible state rather than two events.
 *
 *  Its own steps, one rung above the interaction ladder. A hover tint or a
 *  dropdown is read once it lands, so it should get there; a region opening is
 *  read WHILE it travels, because what the eye follows is the rows arriving
 *  and the content below them making way, and at the ladder's pace that
 *  arrival is over before it has been seen.
 *
 *  The numbers are the host platform's, since this is a desktop app whose
 *  windows sit beside Finder's: `0.25` is what AppKit animates in by default
 *  (`NSAnimationContext`, and Core Animation's implicit transactions), `0.35`
 *  is SwiftUI's default for `.easeInOut`, and the curve is Core Animation's
 *  `kCAMediaTimingFunctionEaseInEaseOut` exactly. A symmetric ease costs a
 *  slow first few pixels, which is the trade the platform already made and
 *  which the longer steps absorb.
 *
 *  These do NOT shorten on the way out, which is the one place the collapse
 *  steps part company with the spring tiers above. A leaving OBJECT is already
 *  understood and should not be waited on, so its exit runs short; a region is
 *  not an object, and AppKit closes one over exactly the length it opened it.
 *  A sidebar that shuts faster than it opened reads as two different controls
 *  rather than one reversible state.
 *
 *  Shaped like a spring tier — a transition carrying its own `exit` — so a
 *  collapse reads `collapseTween[tier]` exactly where it read `spring[tier]`,
 *  and `exitFallbackMs` has a duration to derive from. It is the same step,
 *  named twice rather than measured twice. */
