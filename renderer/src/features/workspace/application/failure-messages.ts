/**
 * One reader-facing sentence per workspace failure kind.
 *
 * Both workspace ladders are answered here: the project's bare transport kinds
 * and the files ladder that adds a name already taken and a name the server
 * refuses. A hook or a view selects by kind instead of forwarding an adapter's
 * own sentence or inventing a fallback, and each map covers the whole ladder,
 * so adding a kind fails the build here rather than shipping a silent blank.
