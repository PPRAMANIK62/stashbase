/**
 * Keeps the file tree's selection on the document in front of the reader.
 *
 * The tree selects the row a reader points at, and that is where the window's
 * creates land; the open set decides which document is actually on screen, and
 * it moves for reasons the tree never sees — a tab activated in the strip, a
 * preview reused by the next browse, document history, a tab closed. Without
 * this the highlighted row is only ever the last row that was clicked, so it
 * outlives the document it named.
 *
 * The rule is one sentence: a document coming in front selects its own row,
 * and when the last one goes the selection it put there leaves with it. A row
 * the reader pointed at themselves — a folder they expanded, a file whose tab
 * they have since closed — is not theirs to clear, so only the row this hook
 * last followed is dropped.
