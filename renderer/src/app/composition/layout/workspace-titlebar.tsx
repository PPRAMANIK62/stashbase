/** The window's title row. Its shared slot shows the open documents' tabs,
 *  ending in the plus that opens the New tab, and otherwise stays empty: the
 *  Chat pane names its own conversation in its header, so the row never has
 *  to, and a hidden panel takes the name away with it. With no folder open
 *  there is no workspace on screen at all, and the row says Welcome instead,
 *  which is what is on screen. A draft starts from the New tab's page, not
 *  from a standing button: it makes a document, and the strip is where
 *  documents show. The expanded sidebar's header carries the collapse
 *  control and the document history's back and forward; only while the
 *  sidebar is collapsed does this titlebar host them, the reopening trigger
 *  and the arrows ahead of the strip, in the same window corner they left.
 *  The chat panel's toggle mirrors that
 *  trigger at the row's far right: the same square in the opposite corner
 *  with the mirrored glyph, present in every folder state so the panel can
 *  always be brought back from where it was hidden, and alone there, so the
 *  corner never changes shape. New chat lives with the conversation, in the
 *  pane's own header, and a hidden pane takes it along. In the sidebar's
 *  Chats mode the Chat has the whole card: the open documents leave it and
 *  their tabs leave this row, whose shared slot names the chat instead, and
 *  the corner rests as empty room, since there is no document pane for the
 *  toggle to give width to. */
