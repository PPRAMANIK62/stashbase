# `shared/runtime`

**Application plumbing**: hooks and providers that no kit primitive consumes,
only `app/` composition and feature hooks — request signal lifetimes, lazily
mounted surfaces, the boundary a surface renders behind so one that throws is
contained rather than taking its window down, command-surface registration,
runtime scoping and retention, scroll anchoring, text-entry focus tracking, and
the provider stack the application mounts.

The boundary draws the recovery and owns none of its words. A caught render
error's message is written for a developer, and a leaf here cannot reach a
feature's `application/failure-messages.ts`, so every caller supplies its own
sentence and its own actions.

It sits under `shared/` rather than `lib/` because `lib/` is the installed
Fluid registry and this is product code. The dependency runs one way: a module
here may import from the kit (`lib/`, `components/`), and no module in the kit
may import from here. That is what keeps the kit installable without the
application, and `kit-does-not-reach-product-code` in
`dependency-cruiser.config.cjs` is what holds it.
