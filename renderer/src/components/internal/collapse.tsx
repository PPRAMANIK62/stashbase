/** The one measured collapse: a clipping box that travels between 0 and its
 *  content's measured pixel height.
 *
 *  Four wrappers in this kit animated exactly that — the composer's
 *  attachment and queue strips, the sidebar's sections and sub-menus, the
 *  reasoning trace's panels, and the space a newly arrived step opens — and
 *  each had rewritten the same three decisions. Never `height: "auto"`:
 *  framer resolves an auto target from the element's VISUAL size, which a
 *  scaled ancestor gets wrong, so the caller measures with `useMeasuredSize`
 *  and hands the pixels in. Never a spring on a height that moved underneath
 *  the animation: the box would chase its own child and land late. And never
 *  a fade that outruns the space closing under it.
 *
 *  What genuinely differed between them was one thing — whether a closed
 *  region keeps its children mounted — which is `presence`. The rest are
 *  options with defaults, so an ordinary disclosure still reads as two props.
