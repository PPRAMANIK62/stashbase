/** Executes the accessibility assertion `.storybook/preview.tsx` declares.
 *
 *  The preview sets `parameters.a11y.test = 'error'`, which only means
 *  anything where a Storybook test runner is running the stories — and CI runs
 *  neither the Storybook test runner nor a browser. So the declaration was
 *  inert: a story could ship a violation and nothing would say so.
 *
 *  This file closes that gap for EVERY story in the renderer, feature stories
 *  included — a Settings panel is as much a shipped surface as a Button. Each
 *  story is mounted inside `StoryFrame`, the same stack the preview decorator
 *  mounts (the two import it from one module, so the claim is structural
 *  rather than a comment), and scored with axe over the whole body — the body
 *  rather than the render container because the overlay primitives portal
 *  their surfaces out of it. The stylesheet is imported for the same reason:
 *  several axe rules read computed visibility, and a story judged without its
 *  CSS is not the story anyone sees.
 *
 *  Three environments per story, because a violation can live in exactly one
 *  of them: the default step, the compact step (smaller type and tighter
 *  targets), and dark. And each story's `play` runs first where it has one, so
 *  the state a story exists to show — a menu open, a value picked — is the
 *  state that gets scored rather than the closed shell in front of it. */

/** The story runner scores the whole body rather than one container, so it

 *  resolves no cascade, so every ratio it could report would be measured
 *  against colours nothing painted. Contrast is a visual-review and browser-run
 *  concern; scoring it here would produce noise, not findings.
 *
 *  The exclusion is Base UI's focus-trap sentinels. Every overlay primitive
 *  brackets its trapped subtree with `aria-hidden` spans that are deliberately
 *  in the tab order, which is exactly what `aria-hidden-focus` looks for.
